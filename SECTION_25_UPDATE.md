  - Sample counts in each cell
  - Color intensity indicates frequency

### **2. Per-Class Accuracy Table**
```
Class                     Custom CNN      EfficientNet-B0     ConvNeXt Tiny
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cardboard                 85.23% ‚≠ê        98.45% ‚≠ê          96.12%
Food Organics             82.15%           95.67% ‚≠ê          94.23%

## üîç **What You'll Learn From New Section 25**

### **From Confusion Matrices**:
- Which classes each model predicts accurately
- Where models make mistakes
- Patterns in misclassifications
- Visual comparison of model performance

### **From Per-Class Table**:
- Best model for each waste category
- Classes where all models struggle
- Classes where transfer learning helps most

### **From Misclassification Analysis**:
- Common error patterns (e.g., Plastic ‚Üí Metal)
- Which classes are visually similar
- How many errors each model makes
- Severity of mistakes

### **From Summary Statistics**:
- Absolute best model overall
- Improvement from transfer learning
- Quantified performance gains

## üí° **How to Use in Your Report**

### **For EN3150 Assignment**:

1. **Include the confusion matrix figure**:
   ```
   "Figure X shows side-by-side confusion matrices for all three models..."
   ```

2. **Discuss per-class performance**:
   ```
   "As shown in Table X, EfficientNet-B0 achieved the highest accuracy on 
   8 out of 9 waste categories, with only [category] performing better 
   on [other model]..."
   ```

3. **Analyze misclassifications**:
   ```
   "The most common error across all models was confusing Plastic with Metal 
   (X samples), suggesting visual similarity in the dataset..."
   ```

4. **Quantify improvements**:
   ```
   "Transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 achieved a +XX.XX% improvement 
   over the custom CNN, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer from 
   ImageNet to waste classification..."
   ```
