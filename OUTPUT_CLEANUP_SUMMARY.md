# Output Cleanup Summary - Sections 1-10

## Changes Applied

### Section 11: Model Evaluation
**Removed emojis and cleaned output:**
- ❌ `"✅ Evaluation completed..."` 
- ✅ `"Evaluation completed..."`  (clean, professional)

**Before:**
```python
print(f"✅ Evaluation completed in {eval_time:.1f}s ({len(test_loader.dataset)/eval_time:.1f} samples/sec)")
```

**After:**
```python
print(f"Evaluation completed in {eval_time:.1f}s ({len(test_loader.dataset)/eval_time:.1f} samples/sec)")
```

## Professional Output Examples

### Good (Current Format):
```
================================================================================
TEST SET EVALUATION
================================================================================
Test Loss: 0.5234
Test Accuracy: 0.8432 (84.32%)
Total Test Samples: 1800
Correctly Classified: 1518
Misclassified: 282
================================================================================
```

### Good (Progress Tracking):
```
Evaluating on 1800 samples (57 batches)...
  Progress: 30/57 (52.6%) | Time: 12.7s | ETA: 11.4s
  Progress: 57/57 (100.0%) | Time: 24.1s | ETA: 0.0s
Evaluation completed in 24.1s (74.7 samples/sec)
```

### Avoided (Too Decorative):
```
🎯 Starting evaluation...
✅ Evaluation completed successfully! 🎉
🏆 Best accuracy achieved! ⭐
```
